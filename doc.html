                <p>When you're ready to deploy your Laravel application to production, there are some important things
                    you can do
                    to make sure your application is running as efficiently as possible. In this document, we'll cover
                    some great
                    starting points for making sure your Laravel application is deployed properly.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>npm install --save-dev laravel-mix</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Install necessary dependencies</li>
                    <li>Configure the web server</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the application is correctly deployed</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are deploying your application to a server that is running Nginx, you may use the following
                    configuration file as a starting point for configuring your web server. Most likely, this file will
                    need to be
                    customized depending on your server's configuration. If you would like assistance in managing your
                    server,
                    consider using a first-party Laravel server management and deployment service such as Laravel Forge.

                <header>Architecture Concepts</header>
                <p>The entry point for all requests to a Laravel application is the public/index.php file. All requests
                    are
                    directed to this file by your web server (Apache / Nginx) configuration. The index.php file doesn't
                    contain much
                    code. Rather, it is a starting point for loading the rest of the framework.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Entry point for Laravel application: public/index.php</li>
                    <li>Web server directs requests to index.php</li>
                    <li>Autoloader is loaded by Composer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The index.php file loads the Composer generated autoloader definition, and then retrieves an instance
                    of the
                    Laravel application from bootstrap/app.php. The first action taken by Laravel itself is to create an
                    instance of
                    the application / service container.</p>

                <p>All Laravel routes are defined in your route files, which are located in the routes directory. These
                    files are
                    automatically loaded by Laravel using the configuration specified in your application's
                    bootstrap/app.php file.
                    The routes/web.php file defines routes that are for your web interface. These routes are assigned
                    the web
                    middleware group, which provides features like session state and CSRF protection.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Routes are defined in route files</li>
                    <li>Web routes are in routes/web.php</li>
                    <li>Middleware group: web (session, CSRF protection)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Sometimes you may wish to execute an Artisan command outside of the CLI. For example, you may wish to
                    execute
                    an Artisan command from a route or controller. You may use the call method on the Artisan facade to
                    accomplish
                    this. The call method accepts either the command's signature name or class name as its first
                    argument, and an
                    array of command parameters as the second argument. The exit code will be returned:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>Artisan::call('cache:clear');</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Artisan commands can be executed outside CLI</li>
                    <li>The `call` method accepts command signatures</li>
                    <li>Exit code is returned after command execution</li>
                </ul>

                <header>Security</header>
                <p>Many web applications provide a way for their users to authenticate with the application and "login".
                    Implementing this feature in web applications can be a complex and potentially risky endeavor. For
                    this
                    reason, Laravel strives to give you the tools you need to implement authentication quickly,
                    securely, and
                    easily.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password]);</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Session guard for authentication</li>
                    <li>Providers for user retrieval from storage</li>
                    <li>Configurable authentication services in `config/auth.php`</li>
                </ul>

                <header>Database</header>
                <p>Laravel's database query builder provides a convenient, fluent interface to creating and running
                    database
                    queries. It can be used to perform most database operations in your application and works perfectly
                    with all of
                    Laravel's supported database systems.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>DB::table('users')->where('id', 1)->get();</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fluent interface for queries</li>
                    <li>Uses PDO binding to prevent SQL injection</li>
                    <li>Works with all supported database systems</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Eloquent_ORM">
                <header>Eloquent ORM</header>
                <p>After glancing at the example above, you may have noticed that we did not tell Eloquent which
                    database table
                    corresponds to our Flight model. By convention, the "snake case", plural name of the class will be
                    used as the
                    table name unless another name is explicitly specified. So, in this case, Eloquent will assume the
                    Flight model
                    stores records in the flights table, while an AirTrafficController model would store records in an
                    air_traffic_controllers table.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>$user = User::find(1);</code></pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatic model to table mapping</li>
                    <li>Supports custom table names</li>
                    <li>Easy querying with methods like `find`, `all`, `where`</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Testing">
                <header>Testing</header>
                <p>Laravel is built with testing in mind. In fact, support for testing with Pest and PHPUnit is included
                    out of
                    the box and a phpunit.xml file is already set up for your application. The framework also ships with
                    convenient
                    helper methods that allow you to expressively test your applications.</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre><code>public function testExample()
{
    $this->assertTrue(true);

                <ul>
                    <li>Support for Pest and PHPUnit</li>
                    <li>Test directories: Feature and Unit</li>
